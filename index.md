### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was one of my favorite lab because it was the first coding project I did in my first year of college. It was the first code I ever compiled and was able to output a text that said "Hello Wen!". In this lab, I was able to learn how to use the compiler and all the git commands.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorite lab because I was able to learn how make the game blackjack into a program. Blackjack is one of my favorite card game and learning how code was enjoyable to me. I was able to write functions that reads the card and determine if it's a number card, a ace, or a face card. I was also able to calculate all the cards to see if the cards is over or below 21.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was one of my favorite lab because I was able to make my first animation. I used RBG and the sine function to make my animation. I was able code an boolean that reads the file name and extension. It checks if the file is long enough and the location of the period of the extension. It also compares the file to see if there is an extension and if there is, it will return true and if there not, it will return false.
